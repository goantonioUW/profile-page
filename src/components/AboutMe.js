                    <p class="card-text"> My name is Antonio Gonzalez. I am a recent graduate of the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at the Universitry of Washington. My goal is to become a fulltime software engeneer. I was born and raised in Seattle. Growing up I was always interested in computers and technology. 
                    
                    
                    . During my time there I thought about getting into computer science but felt like I was already too far behind and was very discouraged. After college I became one of the managers at Nordstrom for womenâ€™s designer shoes. This was fun and I enjoyed managing a team then came COVID. This dramatically changed retail and my position. During Quarantine I had been looking at different jobs and came across the UW full stack course. I figured this is the perfect time for a career change. I want to keep learning more skills so that I can do this fulltime.</p>

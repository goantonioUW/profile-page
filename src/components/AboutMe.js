                    <p class="card-text"> My name is Antonio Gonzalez. I am a recent graduate of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Washington. My goal is to become a full-time software engineer. I was born and raised in Seattle, WA. Growing up, I was always interested in computers and technology. In 8th grade, I attended my first coding camp. Unfortunately, my high school did not offer any classes that related to programming or computer science. After I graduated and attended Bellevue College, I became one of the managers at Nordstrom for womenâ€™s designer shoes. I enjoyed; managing a team and leading projects. After being in this position for over a year, COVID hit! During quarantine, I had been looking for different jobs and came across the UW full-stack Bootcamp. I figured this is the perfect time for a career change. After six long months, I graduated from the Bootcamp and am proud to say that I am a FULL-STACK Developer.</p>

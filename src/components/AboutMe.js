                    <p class="card-text"> My name is Antonio Gonzalez I am currently taking a full stack development class at UW. My goal is to become a web developer and use the skills that I learn to build and maintain websites. I was born and raised in Seattle. Growing up I took a programing class in the 8th grade and really enjoyed it. My high school did not offer any classes that related to programing or web development so, I did not get any further experience with it. I graduated from high school and went on to play basketball at Bellevue college. During my time there I thought about getting into computer science but felt like I was already too far behind and was very discouraged. After college I became one of the managers at Nordstrom for womenâ€™s designer shoes. This was fun and I enjoyed managing a team then came COVID. This dramatically changed retail and my position. During Quarantine I had been looking at different jobs but wanted something with more stability. Then I came across the UW full stack course. I figured this is the perfect time for a career change. This is my second project and I want to keep learning more skills so that I can do this fulltime.</p>
